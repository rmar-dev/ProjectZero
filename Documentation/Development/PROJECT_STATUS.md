## 🏗️ **Architecture Overview**

### **📋 To Be Implemented (Unity)**
1. **Core Architecture Foundation**
   - Modular Unity C# design with organized folder structure
   - Singleton GameStateManager MonoBehaviour for centralized state control
   - Component-based architecture using Unity's system
   - Unity Input System integration

2. **Squad Control Framework**
   - Unified squad control (no individual unit selection)
   - Formation system (Tight, Spread, Wedge)
   - Tactical pause with command queuing
   - Context-sensitive right-click commands

3. **Camera System**
   - Top-down tactical camera with smooth movement
   - WASD movement, mouse wheel zoom, middle-mouse rotation
   - Edge scrolling support
   - Proper UE5 camera controller implementation

4. **State Management**
   - Game states: MainMenu, Loading, InGame, Paused, GameOver
   - Tactical states: RealTime, TacticalPause, SlowMotion, CommandPlanning
   - Time scale control with automatic slow-motion timeout
   - Event-driven state change notifications

### **🚧 Partial Implementation**
1. **Squad System Components**
   - Header files complete with full interface design
   - Core SquadManager implementation exists
   - Missing: SquadPlayerController.cpp implementation
   - Missing: Formation component implementations

2. **Input System**
   - Enhanced Input actions defined in headers
   - Input Mapping Context designed
   - Missing: Blueprint asset creation
   - Missing: Complete input binding implementation

### **📋 Planned Systems**
1. **ATB Combat System**
   - Active Time Battle bars for all units
   - Real-time movement with action timing
   - Slow-motion tactical decision making

2. **Character Creation Pipeline**
   - Blender modeling workflow (200-500 triangles)
   - Mixamo animation integration
   - Unreal import and setup automation

3. **Mission & Extraction Framework**
   - Procedural objective generation
   - Multiple extraction points per mission
   - Time pressure and consequence systems

4. **Faction System**
   - Political relationship tracking
   - Territory control mechanics
   - Consequence-driven gameplay

### **🎯 Immediate Priorities (Next 4 Weeks - Unity Implementation)**

### **Priority 1: Unity Project Foundation**
- [ ] **Set up Unity 2022.3 LTS project** - Essential foundation
- [ ] **Install required Unity packages** - Input System, Cinemachine, NavMesh
- [ ] **Create folder structure** - Organize scripts, prefabs, scenes
- [ ] **Create GameStateManager.cs** - Core state management singleton

### **Priority 2: Character Pipeline Setup**
- [ ] **Set up Blender workflow** - Character creation pipeline
- [ ] **Configure Mixamo integration** - Animation workflow
- [ ] **Create first test character** - Low-poly marine prototype
- [ ] **Test character import process** - Validate full pipeline

### **Priority 3: System Integration Testing**
- [ ] **Level setup and testing** - Verify all systems work together
- [ ] **Input system validation** - Test all tactical controls
- [ ] **Formation system testing** - Verify squad behaviors
- [ ] **Performance baseline** - Establish performance metrics

## 🔧 **Technical Debt & Improvements**

### **Code Quality Improvements**
1. **Ongoing Refactoring**
   - Centralized types in ProjectHiveTypes.h ✅
   - Constants organization in ProjectHiveConstants.h ✅
   - Interface-based architecture (in progress)
   - Component-based squad system (planned)

2. **Legacy System Migration**
   - Ph_CameraController → TacticalCameraController ✅
   - Ph_PlayerController → SquadPlayerController (in progress)
   - Individual unit selection → Squad-only control ✅

### **Performance Considerations**
- Low-poly character optimization (planned)
- Efficient AI behavior trees (designed)
- Component-based architecture (in progress)
- Memory management for squad systems (designed)

## 🚨 **Current Blockers (Unity Port)**

### **Critical (Must Address First)**
1. **No Unity project created yet** - Fundamental blocker
2. **No Unity Input System setup** - Core interaction blocked
3. **No Unity scripts implemented** - All gameplay systems missing

### **Major (Address After Project Setup)**
1. **Character creation pipeline needs Unity conversion** - Content creation blocked
2. **ATB system needs Unity implementation** - Core combat missing
3. **NavMesh integration required** - Movement system needs setup

### **Minor (Address When Possible)**
1. **Performance profiling not done** - Optimization metrics missing
2. **Unit tests not implemented** - Quality assurance limited
3. **Build automation not configured** - Deployment efficiency low

## 🎯 **Success Metrics**

### **Phase 1 Goals (Unity Port)**
- [x] **Complete core architecture design** (Adapted for Unity)
- [ ] **Functional squad movement system** - 0% complete (Unity implementation needed)
- [ ] **Working tactical pause** - 0% complete (Unity Time.timeScale implementation needed)
- [ ] **Basic character in game** - 0% complete (Unity character controller needed)
- [ ] **All input controls functional** - 0% complete (Unity Input System needed)

### **Definition of Phase 1 Complete (Unity)**
- Player can control squad movement with WASD camera using Cinemachine
- Right-click moves squad in formation using Unity NavMesh
- Space bar pauses game using Time.timeScale and allows command queuing
- F key cycles between formations with Unity animation system
- At least one low-poly character displays correctly in Unity scene

## 🔄 **Next Review Date**
**Scheduled:** August 30, 2025  
**Focus:** Phase 1 completion assessment and Phase 2 planning

---

## 📝 **Notes for Future Development**
1. **Architecture is solid** - Focus on implementation over design
2. **Documentation quality is high** - Maintain this standard
3. **Modular design working well** - Continue component-based approach
4. **Enhanced Input System** - Requires more Blueprint work than expected
5. **Character pipeline** - Will likely need dedicated sprint focus

**Key Decision Pending:** Final character art style validation with actual in-game models
