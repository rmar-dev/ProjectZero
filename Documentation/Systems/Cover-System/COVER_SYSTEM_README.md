# Cover System Implementation Guide

## Overview
This guide provides step-by-step instructions for implementing and using the Cover System in ProjectHive. The system is built around position-based cover where units move to specific positions to gain tactical advantages.

## 🚀 Quick Navigation

### New to the System?
1. Start with [Quick Start Guide](01_QuickStart.md) - 5 minutes to working cover
2. Follow [Blueprint Guide](03_BlueprintGuide.md) - Set up your first cover points
3. Use [Testing Guide](04_Testing.md) - Verify everything works

### Ready to Implement?
1. Read [Detailed Guide](02_DetailedGuide.md) - Complete implementation
2. Check [Examples](Examples/ExampleLevel.md) - See it in action
3. Explore [Advanced Features](05_Advanced.md) - Customize for your needs

### Having Issues?
1. Check [Troubleshooting](Examples/Troubleshooting.md) - Common problems
2. Use [Testing Guide](04_Testing.md) - Debug tools and methods

## 🎯 System Architecture

### Core Components
1. **UCoverDetectionComponent** - Handles cover mechanics (health, occupancy, etc.)
2. **ICoverDetectable** - Interface for objects that provide cover
3. **ACoverPoint** - Position markers where units can take cover
4. **UCoverPointManager** - Manages multiple cover points

### How It Works
```
[Unit] → [Seeks Cover] → [CoverPoint] → [Uses CoverDetectionComponent] → [Gets Protection]
```

### Key Features
- ✅ **Health & Destruction**: Cover can be damaged and destroyed
- ✅ **Occupancy Management**: Multiple units per cover point
- ✅ **Reservation System**: Units can reserve cover before reaching it
- ✅ **Material System**: Different materials have different resistances
- ✅ **Event System**: React to cover changes with delegates
- ✅ **Blueprint Integration**: Full Blueprint support with C++ performance
- ✅ **Debug Tools**: Visual debugging and testing utilities

## 📋 Implementation Checklist

### Phase 1: Basic Setup (30 minutes)

## 🎮 Expected Gameplay

After implementation, your cover system will support:

### Player Experience
- **Tactical Positioning**: Units gain combat bonuses from cover
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indicators of cover effectiveness
- **Strategic Depth**: Cover can be destroyed, forcing repositioning
- **Intuitive Controls**: Easy-to-understand cover mechanics

### AI Behavior
- **Smart Positioning**: AI seeks appropriate cover based on threats
- **Dynamic Tactics**: AI adapts when cover is destroyed
- **Reservation System**: Multiple units coordinate cover usage
- **Threat Assessment**: AI evaluates cover effectiveness

### Level Design
- **Flexible Placement**: Easy-to-use cover point system
- **Visual Debug Tools**: Clear feedback during level creation
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient cover detection and management
- **Designer-Friendly**: Minimal technical knowledge required

## 📞 Support and Resources

### Getting Help
1. **Console Commands**: Use debug commands for troubleshooting
2. **Visual Debug Tools**: Enable wireframe debugging
3. **Log Output**: Monitor component behavior via output log
4. **Blueprint Debugging**: Use Blueprint debugger for event tracing

### Performance Considerations
- **Optimization**: System designed for 100+ cover points
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient weak pointer management
- **Update Frequency**: Minimal per-frame overhead
- **Scalability**: Suitable for both small and large levels
