# Cover System Fix Status and Documentation

## Overview
This document tracks the progress of fixes applied to the Cover System, specifically addressing issues with cover point occupancy tracking, reservation management, and debug feedback.

## Issues Addressed ✅

### 1. **CoverSystemManager Reservation Methods** - FIXED
**Issue**: ReserveCoverPoint_Native and ReleaseCoverPoint_Native methods were not calling the actual CoverPoint reservation methods.

**Solution Applied**:
- Fixed `ReserveCoverPoint_Native()` to call `CoverPoint->ReserveCoverPoint(Unit)`
- Fixed `ReleaseCoverPoint_Native()` to call `CoverPoint->ReleaseCoverPointReservation(Unit)`
- Proper error handling and logging added

**Files Modified**:
- `Source/Terrain/Private/CoverSystemManager.cpp` (lines 120-157)

### 2. **CoverPoint IsAvailable Method** - FIXED
**Issue**: Reserved cover points were still reporting as available to other actors.

**Solution Applied**:
- Updated `IsAvailable()` method to return false for reserved cover points
- Only available cover points with open slots now report as available
- Proper state checking implemented

**Files Modified**:
- `Source/Terrain/Public/CoverPoint.h` (lines 301-305)

### 3. **Unit Assignment Reservation Clearing** - FIXED
**Issue**: When a unit occupied a cover point it had reserved, the reservation wasn't being cleared.

**Solution Applied**:
- Added proper type casting in `AssignUnit()` method
- Fixed comparison: `ReservingActor.Get() == Cast<AActor>(Unit)`
- Added logging for reservation clearing

**Files Modified**:
- `Source/Terrain/Private/CoverPoint.cpp` (line 282)

### 4. **Debug Message Enhancement** - FIXED
**Issue**: Debug messages didn't show live state information with reservation details.

**Solution Applied**:
- Enhanced hover and click debug messages
- Added reservation information display
- Added actual occupying unit names in debug output
- Added live availability status

**Files Modified**:
- `Source/Terrain/Private/CoverPoint.cpp` (OnClicked method, lines 427-468)

## Current Issue 🔍

### **Slot Counting Display Problem** - IN PROGRESS
**Issue**: Cover points consistently show "0/1" occupied slots even when units should be assigned.

**Status**: Under investigation with enhanced debugging

**Symptoms**:
- Availability and reservation systems work correctly
- Cover point states update properly
- Slot count always displays 0/1 regardless of actual occupancy
- `GetOccupiedSlots()` returns 0 even when units should be assigned

**Debug Tools Added**:
1. **Enhanced AssignUnit Logging**:
   ```cpp
   UE_LOG(LogTemp, Log, TEXT("%s: AssignUnit called for %s"), *GetName(), Unit->GetName());
   UE_LOG(LogTemp, Log, TEXT("%s: Current OccupyingUnits count BEFORE: %d"), *GetName(), OccupyingUnits.Num());
   UE_LOG(LogTemp, Log, TEXT("%s: Added unit %s to OccupyingUnits. Count is now: %d"), *GetName(), *Unit->GetName(), OccupyingUnits.Num());
   ```

2. **New DebugOccupancyState Method**:
   - Added `UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable) void DebugOccupancyState()`
   - Shows real-time array size, method return values, and unit list
   - Available in Blueprint Details panel under "Cover Debug"

**Investigation Plan**:
1. Use `DebugOccupancyState()` to verify actual vs reported values
2. Check if `AssignUnit()` is being called at all
3. Verify if `OccupyingUnits` array is being populated correctly
4. Investigate if array is being cleared after assignment

## Files Modified

### Core Implementation Files
- `Source/Terrain/Private/CoverSystemManager.cpp`
- `Source/Terrain/Private/CoverPoint.cpp`
- `Source/Terrain/Public/CoverPoint.h`

### Key Methods Updated
1. **CoverSystemManager**:
   - `ReserveCoverPoint_Native()`
   - `ReleaseCoverPoint_Native()`

2. **CoverPoint**:
   - `IsAvailable()`
   - `AssignUnit()`
   - `OnClicked()` (debug messages)
   - `DebugOccupancyState()` (new)

## Testing Instructions

### For Developers
1. **Compile the project** (close editor if Live Coding is active)
2. **Test reservation system**:
   - Units should properly reserve cover points
   - Reserved points should show as unavailable to other units
   - Reservations should clear when unit occupies the point

3. **Test slot counting**:
   - Select any cover point in editor
   - Use "Debug Occupancy State" button in Details panel
   - Check console output for detailed state information
   - Verify actual array size vs displayed slot count

### Debug Console Commands
```cpp
// In editor console (press ~)
// No direct console commands yet, use Blueprint debug functions
```

### Expected Behavior
- **Reservation**: Cover points should reserve/release properly
- **Availability**: Reserved points should not be available to other actors
- **Occupancy**: Units should properly occupy cover points
- **Slot Display**: Should show correct occupied/total slots (currently shows 0/1)

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Use debug tools to identify root cause of slot counting issue
2. **Investigate**: Whether `AssignUnit()` is being called by units
3. **Verify**: If `OccupyingUnits` array is being modified elsewhere
4. **Fix**: Slot counting display once root cause is identified
5. **Test**: Full integration testing with multiple units and cover points

## Code Quality Notes

### Improvements Made
- Added comprehensive error logging
- Proper null checking and validation
- Enhanced debug output for troubleshooting
- Type-safe casting for actor comparisons

### Architecture
- Maintains backward compatibility
- Follows existing code patterns
- Proper separation of concerns between CoverPoint and CoverSystemManager

## Performance Impact
- Minimal: Only added debug logging and a few conditional checks
- Debug methods only run when explicitly called
- No impact on runtime performance in shipping builds
