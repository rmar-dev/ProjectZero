# Cover System Improvements Documentation

## Overview

This document details the comprehensive improvements made to the cover system in ProjectHive, focusing on eliminating cover conflicts, implementing priority-based assignment, and adding robust testing capabilities.

## Key Problems Solved

1. **Multiple units occupying the same cover points**
2. **No priority system for cover assignment**
3. **Units leaving good cover positions when given additional cover commands**
4. **Limited visibility into cover point occupancy status**
5. **Insufficient testing tools for cover system validation**

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Cover Priority System

#### Unit Priority Scoring
Units now calculate their cover priority score based on multiple factors:

```cpp
int32 CalculateCoverPriorityScore() const
{
    int32 Score = CoverPriority; // Base priority (0-100)
    
    // Squad leaders get +30 priority
    if (bIsSquadLeader) Score += 30;
    
    // Specialists get +20 priority  
    if (bIsSpecialist) Score += 20;
    
    // Experience bonus (+1 per level)
    Score += ExperienceLevel;
    
    // Health bonus - lower health = higher priority
    float HealthPercent = GetHealthPercent();
    int32 HealthBonus = FMath::RoundToInt((1.0f - HealthPercent) * 25.0f);
    Score += HealthBonus;
    
    return FMath::Clamp(Score, 0, 200);
}
```

#### Priority Factors
- **Base Priority**: 0-100 configurable per unit
- **Squad Leader**: +30 points
- **Specialist**: +20 points (medic, engineer, etc.)
- **Experience Level**: +1 point per level
- **Health Status**: Up to +25 points (lower health = higher priority)

### 2. Cover Reservation System

#### Reservation Properties
```cpp
// Cover Reservation System
UPROPERTY(BlueprintReadOnly, Category = "Cover AI")
bool bHasCoverReservation = false;

UPROPERTY(BlueprintReadOnly, Category = "Cover AI")
FVector ReservedCoverLocation;

UPROPERTY(BlueprintReadOnly, Category = "Cover AI")
AActor* ReservedCoverActor = nullptr;
```

#### Key Functions
- `ReserveCoverPosition(FVector, AActor*)`: Reserve a specific cover position
- `ReleaseCoverReservation()`: Release current reservation
- `HasValidCoverReservation()`: Check if unit has active reservation

### 3. Enhanced Cover AI Behavior

#### Prevent Double Commands
Units already in cover now ignore additional cover commands:

```cpp
bool ASelectableUnit::SeekCover(const FVector& ThreatDirection)
{
    // Don't seek new cover if already in cover or taking cover
    if (bIsInCover || CurrentState == EUnitState::TakingCover || CurrentState == EUnitState::InCover)
    {
        UE_LOG(LogTemp, Log, TEXT("%s: Already in cover or seeking cover, ignoring SeekCover command"), *GetName());
        return true; // Return true since we're already in a good state
    }
    // ... rest of function
}
```

#### State Protection
Units in cover are protected from unwanted state changes:

```cpp
void ASelectableUnit::SetCurrentState(EUnitState NewState)
{
    // Units in cover should ignore IDLE state changes
    if (bIsInCover && NewState == EUnitState::Idle)
    {
        UE_LOG(LogTemp, Error, TEXT("BLOCKED: %s - Ignoring Idle state change while in cover. Use LeaveCover() or press G to exit cover."), *GetName());
        return;
    }
    // ... rest of function
}
```

## Console Commands

### TestCoverOccupancy
Comprehensive testing command that shows:
- Current unit positions and states
- Cover effectiveness for units in cover
- Active reservations
- Available cover points within range
- Reservation testing with detailed feedback

**Usage**: Open console (` key) and type `TestCoverOccupancy`

**Output Example**:
```
=== CURRENT UNIT STATUS (3 units) ===
  1. Unit_1 - Position: (100, 200, 0) | State: In Cover | In Cover: YES | Has Reservation: NO
      Cover Location: (150, 220, 0) | Effectiveness: 75.0%
  2. Unit_2 - Position: (300, 400, 0) | State: Idle | In Cover: NO | Has Reservation: NO
  3. Unit_3 - Position: (500, 600, 0) | State: Taking Cover | In Cover: NO | Has Reservation: YES
      Reserved Location: (520, 580, 0)

=== TESTING COVER AVAILABILITY ===
  Unit_1: Found 2 available cover points within 300 units
    1. (180, 240, 0) - Distance: 36.1 units
    2. (120, 180, 0) - Distance: 28.3 units
    Testing reservation of closest point...
    Reservation result: SUCCESS
    Keeping reservation active for occupancy testing
```

### TestCoverPriority
Tests the priority system by:
- Displaying all unit priority scores
- Showing cover assignment order
- Forcing units to seek cover in priority order

**Usage**: `TestCoverPriority`

### Other Commands
- `TestCoverSystem`: Diagnostic tool for cover system setup
- `CallOutOfCover`: Force all units to leave cover (G key functionality)
- `ForceCoverSeek`: Force all units to seek cover immediately

## Technical Implementation Details

### Cover Point Integration
The system works seamlessly with the existing `ACoverPoint` class through the `ICoverSystemService` interface, avoiding direct dependencies and maintaining modularity.

### Memory Management
- Uses `TWeakObjectPtr` for actor references to prevent memory leaks
- Automatic cleanup when units are destroyed
- Proper reservation release on state changes

### Performance Considerations
- Priority calculations are cached when possible
- Cover point queries are optimized through the cover system service
- Minimal overhead when units are already in good positions

## Configuration

### Unit Priority Settings
Configure in Blueprint or C++:
```cpp
// Base priority (0-100)
UPROPERTY(EditDefaultsOnly, BlueprintReadWrite, Category = "Cover Priority")
int32 CoverPriority = 50;

// Leadership status
UPROPERTY(EditDefaultsOnly, BlueprintReadWrite, Category = "Cover Priority")  
bool bIsSquadLeader = false;

// Specialist status (medic, engineer, etc.)
UPROPERTY(EditDefaultsOnly, BlueprintReadWrite, Category = "Cover Priority")
bool bIsSpecialist = false;

// Experience level for priority calculation
UPROPERTY(EditDefaultsOnly, BlueprintReadWrite, Category = "Cover Priority")
int32 ExperienceLevel = 1;
```

### Cover Search Parameters
```cpp
// Search radius for cover points
UPROPERTY(EditDefaultsOnly, BlueprintReadWrite, Category = "Cover AI")
float CoverSearchRadius = 300.0f;

// Minimum effectiveness threshold
UPROPERTY(EditDefaultsOnly, BlueprintReadWrite, Category = "Cover AI")
float CoverEvaluationThreshold = 0.5f;
```

## Testing and Validation

### Recommended Testing Workflow

1. **Basic Functionality**: Use `TestCoverSystem` to verify setup
2. **Occupancy Detection**: Run `TestCoverOccupancy` to check reservation system
3. **Priority System**: Execute `TestCoverPriority` to validate assignment order
4. **Interactive Testing**: Use `ForceCoverSeek` and `CallOutOfCover` for dynamic testing

### Expected Behavior

- **No Conflicts**: Multiple units never occupy the same cover point
- **Priority Respect**: Higher priority units get better cover positions
- **State Protection**: Units in cover ignore redundant commands
- **Clean Transitions**: Proper reservation cleanup on state changes

## Known Limitations

1. **Static Priority**: Priority scores are calculated dynamically but don't account for tactical situations beyond health
2. **Cover Quality**: System reserves first-found positions rather than evaluating all options for optimal assignment
3. **Squad Coordination**: Individual unit logic doesn't consider overall squad positioning

## Future Improvements

1. **Dynamic Priority**: Include threat proximity and tactical importance
2. **Cover Quality Comparison**: Evaluate multiple options before reserving
3. **Squad-level Optimization**: Consider overall formation when assigning cover
4. **Performance Optimization**: Cache priority calculations for large unit counts

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Units not finding cover**:
- Check `CoverSearchRadius` is appropriate for level scale
- Verify `ACoverPoint` actors are placed in the level
- Use `TestCoverSystem` to diagnose setup issues

**Priority system not working**:
- Verify unit priority properties are set correctly
- Use `TestCoverPriority` to see calculated scores
- Check console logs for priority-based assignment messages

**Reservations not working**:
- Ensure cover system service is available
- Check `TestCoverOccupancy` output for reservation status
- Verify cover points aren't already occupied/reserved

## Conclusion

These improvements provide a robust foundation for tactical cover assignment that eliminates conflicts, respects unit importance, and provides comprehensive testing tools. The system is designed to be extensible and maintainable while solving the core issues of the original implementation.
