# Unity Cover System Implementation Guide - ProjectZero

## Overview
This guide provides step-by-step instructions for implementing and using the Cover System in ProjectZero Unity port. The system is built around GameObject-based cover where units move to specific positions to gain tactical advantages using Unity's built-in systems.

## 🚀 Quick Navigation

### New to Unity Cover System?
1. Start with [Unity Quick Start Guide](Unity_QuickStart.md) - 5 minutes to working cover
2. Follow [Unity Prefab Guide](Unity_PrefabGuide.md) - Set up your first cover points
3. Use [Unity Testing Guide](Unity_Testing.md) - Verify everything works

### Ready to Implement?
1. Read [Unity Detailed Guide](Unity_DetailedGuide.md) - Complete implementation
2. Check Unity Examples - See it in action
3. Explore Advanced Unity Features - Customize for your needs

### Having Issues?
1. Check Unity Troubleshooting - Common Unity-specific problems

## 🎯 Unity System Architecture

### Core Unity Components
1. **CoverPoint.cs** - MonoBehaviour handling cover mechanics (health, occupancy, etc.)
2. **ICoverDetectable.cs** - Interface for GameObjects that provide cover
3. **CoverManager.cs** - Singleton managing multiple cover points
4. **CoverSystemConfig.cs** - ScriptableObject for configuration data

### How It Works in Unity
```
[SelectableUnit] → [Seeks Cover] → [CoverPoint GameObject] → [Uses CoverPoint Component] → [Gets Protection]
```

### Key Unity Features
- ✅ **GameObject-Based**: Cover points are GameObjects with components
- ✅ **Layer-Based Detection**: Use Unity layers for efficient cover detection  
- ✅ **Health & Destruction**: Cover can be damaged using Unity's damage system
- ✅ **Occupancy Management**: Multiple units per cover point using Unity collections
- ✅ **Reservation System**: Units can reserve cover using Unity coroutines
- ✅ **Material System**: Different Unity materials have different resistances
- ✅ **Unity Events**: React to cover changes with UnityEvent system
- ✅ **Prefab Variants**: Easy cover customization using Unity prefab variants
- ✅ **Gizmos & Debug**: Visual debugging using Unity's Gizmos system

## 📋 Unity Implementation Checklist

### Phase 1: Unity Basic Setup (30 minutes)
- [ ] Create Unity project structure
- [ ] Set up cover layer in Layer Manager
- [ ] Create basic CoverPoint.cs script
- [ ] Create CoverPoint prefab
- [ ] Place in test scene with NavMesh

### Phase 2: Unity Integration (1-2 hours)  
- [ ] Set up CoverManager singleton
- [ ] Connect to SelectableUnit NavMesh system
- [ ] Implement cover bonuses in Health.cs component
- [ ] Add Unity UI visual feedback

### Phase 3: Unity Polish (2-4 hours)
