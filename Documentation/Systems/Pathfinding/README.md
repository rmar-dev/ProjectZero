## 🚀 Quick Start

For detailed implementation tasks and timeline, see the [Task Breakdown Document](../../Tasks/3D_Grid_Pathfinding_Task_Breakdown.md).

## 📊 System Overview

The 3D Grid Pathfinding System is designed to provide:
- Grid-based movement for tactical gameplay
- 3D pathfinding with vertical movement support
- Squad formation and coordination
- Real-time pathfinding performance
- Integration with existing squad management system

## 🎯 Development Status

**Current Phase**: Foundation Implementation (Task 1.1 Complete)  
**Completed**: Grid data structures, coordinate conversion, obstacle detection  
**Next Priority**: A* Pathfinding Algorithm (Task 2.1)  
**Estimated Timeline**: 8-12 weeks with 2-3 developers  
**Critical Path**: ✅ Grid Foundation → A* Algorithm → Unit Movement → Squad Coordination
