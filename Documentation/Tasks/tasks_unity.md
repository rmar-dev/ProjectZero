- [ ] **Unity Input System Integration** - All controls need Unity implementation:
  - [ ] Camera movement (WASD), zoom, rotation with Cinemachine
  - [ ] Squad movement (right-click) with Unity NavMesh Agent
  - [ ] Formation cycling (F key)
  - [ ] Tactical pause (Space bar) using Time.timeScale
- [ ] **Character System** - Unity character controller with NavMesh Agent
- [ ] **Cover System Infrastructure** - Unity cover point GameObject system
- [ ] **Test Scene** - Unity scene with proper game manager configuration

## üöß **PHASE 2: SQUAD MOVEMENT & COVER INTEGRATION** (October 2025)

**Phase 2 Status: Pending Phase 1 completion**

### **Unity-Specific Implementation Goals**
- Convert UE5 cover system to Unity GameObject-based system
- Implement Unity NavMesh-based pathfinding for cover seeking
- Use Unity's layer system for cover detection
- Integrate with Unity's built-in collision detection

### **üìã Future Tasks for Phase 2**
- [ ] **Unit Cover AI Implementation (Unity)**
  - [ ] Create CoverPoint.cs MonoBehaviour for cover positions
  - [ ] Implement cover evaluation using Unity's spatial queries
  - [ ] Add automatic cover seeking behavior using NavMesh

## üìà **UPCOMING PHASES**

### **Phase 3: Character Art Pipeline (Unity)** (November 2025)
- Character creation workflow (Blender ‚Üí Mixamo ‚Üí Unity)
- Unity Animator Controller setup
- Production-ready marine models with Unity materials

### **Phase 4: ATB Combat System (Unity)** (December 2025)
- Unity-based ATB implementation using Coroutines
- Combat integration with Unity's built-in systems
- Weapon systems using Unity's physics

## üìù **Unity-Specific Development Notes**

### **Key Unity Features to Leverage**
- **NavMesh System** - For squad movement and AI pathfinding
- **Input System** - Modern input handling with action maps
- **Cinemachine** - Professional camera control for tactical view
- **Unity Events** - For loose coupling between systems
- **ScriptableObjects** - For faction data and configuration
- **Coroutines** - For ATB timing and smooth transitions
- **Layer System** - For cover detection and line-of-sight
- **Unity UI** - For tactical interface and HUD

### **Migration Considerations**
- Convert UE5 delegates to Unity Events
- Replace UE5 components with Unity MonoBehaviour equivalents
- Use Unity's built-in physics instead of UE5 physics
- Leverage Unity's cross-platform deployment capabilities
