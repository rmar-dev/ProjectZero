- **Input System** - Modern input handling with action maps
- **Cinemachine** - Professional camera control for tactical view
- **Unity Events** - For loose coupling between systems
- **ScriptableObjects** - For faction data and configuration
- **Coroutines** - For ATB timing and smooth transitions
- **Layer System** - For cover detection and line-of-sight
- **Unity UI** - For tactical interface and HUD

### **Migration Considerations**
- Convert UE5 delegates to Unity Events
- Replace UE5 components with Unity MonoBehaviour equivalents
- Use Unity's built-in physics instead of UE5 physics
- Leverage Unity's cross-platform deployment capabilities
